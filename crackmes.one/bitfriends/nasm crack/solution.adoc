== Analysis

The goal will find the "correct" message and it's a 64 bits program..

Take radare2  <<radare2>>, to analyze the binary.

NOTE: please use the git version of radare2 to be up to date

----
$ r2 nasm_crack
 -- git blind --hard
[0x00401028]>
----

Don't forget, use *aaa* option to disassemble the crackme.
The entry point with Cutter is named by a _flag_ *entry0*

NOTE: a flag is a litteral or a identifier in a radare jargon

[source]
----
[0x00401028]> aaa
[x] Analyze all flags starting with sym. and entry0 (aa)
[x] Analyze function calls (aac)
[x] Analyze len bytes of instructions for references (aar)
[x] Check for objc references
[x] Check for vtables
[x] Type matching analysis for all functions (aaft)
[x] Propagate noreturn information
[x] Use -AA or aaaa to perform additional experimental analysis.

To navigate efficiently in the code, we can use *Vp* command.

[0x00401028]> Vp

TIP:  we can navigate with *arrow* keys or *h*,
*j*, *k*, *l* keys like in VIM text editor.

According to <<linux-x64-syscall-table>>, the code between 0x401028 and
0x401041, print the message _"Enter your password: "._

Add a comment at 0x401041, by pressing *;* key an validate it by *enter*/*return* key.

The code between 0x401043 and 0x40105c, grab the user entry.

The user entry string will be a length of 16 characters.

image::images/03.png[]

The code between 0x40105e and 0x401077 compare the content of
address pointed by rsi and rdi until ecx will be equals to zero or
a characters is different during the loop iteration.
If all characters are equals the je nmemonic at 0x401079 will be
taken.

To jump, on this line, press *enter*/*return* key to jump at loc.correct_fun

image::images/05.png[]

TIP: to return before the jump press the *u* key.

Great, if so the answer is the value pointed by rdi, so *loc.passwd*.

The right value is *supersecret*.
